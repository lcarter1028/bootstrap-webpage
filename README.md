Thanks for checking out my work!

the head is very basic stuff.

the nav bar has funcitonal buttons jumping you to different parts of the page. also when you collapse the page the nav buttons do change to a hamburger.

main section has almost everything ive learned from the bootstrap lessons from codingtemple, plus outside help on the parts they did not cover.
the email and password is required. Tried using the validation classes taught in the course but after hours of messing with it with AI's help, found out the invalid-feedback wont flag the field red without JS, not sure why it was requested to be used.
the table has a border, hover feature, and striped lines.

one of the buttons will disappear from view after the screen size is shrunk at the bottom of the page
